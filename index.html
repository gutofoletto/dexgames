                    <h3>Pinchicken</h3>
                    <p>
                        The mechanics of Pinchiken game is, basically, to pinch eggs that appear on the ground and drop it on the right chicken nest. The scene is composed by three chicken nests with chickens and eggs that keep falling on the ground. When the player pinch and egg, the game will highlight only one nest to drop the egg on. When the player succeeds moving the egg to the right nest, 10 points are awarded, a sound and a visual effect are played as feedback. When it is mistakenly placed, negative sound and visual feedback are played, but no points are awarded neither subtracted. Punishing the player is not the intention, because it can affect player motivation.

                    <h3>Finger-Hero</h3>
                    <p>
                        The prototype Finger-Hero is based on the mechanics of a blockbuster game called "Guitar-Hero". There are 4 lanes, each one has a flower at the end with a color (green, red, blue, yellow) and a thumb opposition gesture (index, middle, ring, pinky) associated. The game will randomly spawn bees that will move towards the flowers on each respective lane. The objective is to execute the correct opposition gesture when the bee is right above the flower. For example, if there is a blue bee on the third lane, as represented on Figure 4, the player should do the thumb opposition gesture with his ring finer when the bee is exactly over the blue flower. If he succeeds, 10 points are awarded and positive sound and visual feedback is given. Else if he misses only negative sound and visual feedback are given <span style="float:right">.<span>

                    <p>
                        On Grabduzeedo the player controls a spaceship with the hand and the tractor beam can be activated and deactivated using the grab and release gestures. The game will spawn sheep on a platform on the right side of the screen. The objective is to abduct the sheep, closing the hand (grabbing), and moving it to the platform with fences on the left. Just open the hand to release the sheep in place. When the sheep is placed inside the fence 10 points are awarded and positive sound and visual feedbacks are given. Otherwise, negative feedback is given, but no points are awarded or subtracted from the player.
